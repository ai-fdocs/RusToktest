- ✅ 1 cleanup performed (unused import removed)

**Verified Modules:**
1. ✅ rustok-content: Uses TransactionalEventBus ✓
2. ✅ rustok-commerce: Uses TransactionalEventBus ✓
3. ✅ rustok-blog: Uses TransactionalEventBus (via NodeService) ✓
4. ✅ rustok-forum: Uses TransactionalEventBus (via NodeService) ✓

- Modified: `apps/server/src/graphql/content/query.rs` (cleanup)
- Modified: `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PROGRESS.md` (Sprint 1 complete)

**Guarantees Verified:**
- ✅ **Atomicity:** Events published only if transactions commit
- ✅ **Consistency:** Write model and events stay in sync
- ✅ **Reliability:** No lost events due to rollbacks
- ✅ **CQRS Integrity:** Read models receive all write events
